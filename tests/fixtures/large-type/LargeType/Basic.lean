-- `oversizedType` has a 150-arrow type that pretty-prints to ~23 KB (the pp
-- nesting indent makes depth, not width, the multiplier). Extraction must emit a
-- *bounded* `statement_text` for it (see docs/architecture/worker-frame-sizing.md):
-- an unbounded row would overrun the worker's 1 MiB frame on real corpora. The
-- count is kept well under the worker's default pretty-printer recursion limit so
-- the type renders (and is then truncated) rather than failing to pretty-print.
